Test name : test_04
Aim : test a reading (REP OUTS) of an expand-down data segment with a base address and a limit critically configured 
("effective limit" > 0xffff = upper-bound)

result : 
- with Vmware : #GP caused by reading out of limit buffer
- with Ramooflax : no #GP : no check of segment limit. reading without pb.
