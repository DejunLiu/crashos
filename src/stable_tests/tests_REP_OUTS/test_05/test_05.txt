Test name : test_05
Aim : test a writing more than 0x82 (=130) bytes into serial port COM1

Result : with Vmware : no problem
with Ramooflax : crash (cf log) : buffer overflow in the io memory -> overrides the rest of the memory (for example the vmcs cache structure)
 + if overriden with a correct value of the "VMCS", Vmware crash

Pb in Ramooflax : no test if sz->miss <= size_of_buffer_uart (=64)
